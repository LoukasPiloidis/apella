# apella
An online voting platform for movies.

It's Saturday night, you with your groups of friends decided to Netflix and chill, but alas, you can't decide on a movie to watch! Apella comes to the rescue with its user-friendly environment, letting you and your group select and vote on potential prospects. An image is a thousand words, everyone knows that, and Apella's visualizing of everyone's opinions makes it really easy to decide on a film.

At the moment, the app is connected to the IMDb public api because it has no database of its own. Brace yourselves, though, because a major update is coming. New features will include:

1. Integrated database deployed specifically for the purpose of this app.
2. Possibility to share the voting form link with other devices.
3. Possibility to create an account and store personal preferences, movies, and friends.


... and many more.

Stay tuned and await until early January 2021. Until then, feel free to explore and suggest any potential add-ons/fixes/bugs.
